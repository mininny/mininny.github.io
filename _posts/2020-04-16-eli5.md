# ELI5
Ever heard that phrase?
It stands for: 
- Explain
- Like
- I'm 
- 5

Basically, simplifying complicated concepts!

And apparently, teaching and explaining things in a very easy and simple terms is a very effective method of learning. So, I'm going to use this space to jot down any new things that I learnt that is worth "translating" into simple terms. 

Let's see if it works!
