## Hi! 
I'm Minhyuk Kim, currently iOS Software engineer based in Korea. Over the past couple of years, I have been involved with iOS development and is currently working as a iOS Engineer at SendBird.

I'm currently heavily interested in Machine Learning and AI. Someday, I hope to work at Apple at CoreML team.
