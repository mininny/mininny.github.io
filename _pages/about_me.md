I'm Minhyuk Kim, currently iOS Software engineer at SendBird Calls team. Over the past couple of years, I have been involved with iOS development and was selected as one of Apple's WWDC Scholarship Recipient for WWDC19. 

I'm currently interested in Machine Learning and AI. Hopefully I'll be at Apple's CoreML Team! ✌️
